# Jiu-Jitsu Tube

Jiu-Jitsu Tube is a full-stack responsive app that allows users to access and add high quality curated YouTube jiu-jitsu videos in a central location.

# Use-case

This app is designed to allow users a space for viewing and sharing curated jiu-jitsu videos. Future expansion of the app will include allowing the user to categorize and comment on videos. Further expansion will allow users to search and add youtube content directly on the app. This app is designed for a designated community to create a repository of all the youtube content relevant to that community. In this case, it is jiu-jitsu, but with slight modifcations, this app would be relevent to any community that would like to have a curated repository of youtube videos.
